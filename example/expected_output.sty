% This command isn't used anywhere, so it will get stripped out.
% But these comments will not. In fact, anything that isn't
% a command definition on a single line should be left alone.

% These will both be stripped out.
% This is because \unusedNestBottom is only ever used in the
% definition of \unusedNestTop which is not used anywhere else.

% Since \upperNestTop is called, all four of the following will
% be retained.
\newcommand{\nestBot}{{3x-2}}
\newcommand{\nestMidA}{{8^\nestBot}}
\newcommand{\nestMidB}{{95}}
\newcommand{\nestTop}{X^\nestMidA_\nestMidB + 8}

% This is used in sample2.tex.
%   macroclean sample_macros.sty sample1.tex
% will strip this line, while
%   macroclean sample_macros.sty sample1.tex sample2.tex
% will retain it.
